# Problem Statement
Printed circuit board (PCB) is the fundamental carrier in electronic devices on which a great number of elements are placed and the quality of the PCB will directly impact the performance of electronic devices.
To avoid shortcomings of manual detection, an automated optical inspection (AOI) based on machine vision need to be proposed.
### **Major Use Case** - Detection and Classification of defects in PCBs
